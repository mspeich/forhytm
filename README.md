# forhytm
A dynamic water balance model for numerical experiments

This repository contains the source code of the toy model FORHYTM, as described in a paper in preparation by Speich et al. In a first step, the aim is to make the code available to the reviewers of this paper. Later, this repository shall provide the source code to anyone interested. Along with the source code, a sample dataset to run the model with is provided.

# Package installation

TODO

# Source code

The R code files can be downloaded from the folder "R".

# Sample data

The sample data contains five years (2002-2007) of meteorological data measured at Erlenbach, Switzerland. The aim is to provide some data with which the model can be run and tested. This dataset contains the following variables:

Hourly data:
- Precipitation [mm]
- Air temperature [Â°C]
- Relative humidity (0 ... 1)
- Global radiation [W/m2]
- Wind speed [m/s]

Daily data:
- Relative sunshine duration (0...1) (obtained from actual SSD, expressed as a fraction of day length as calculated with the R package sirad)

If you wish to use the Erlenbach data for your own research, please see: http://www.wsl.ch/fe/gebirgshydrologie/testgebiet_alptal/data/index_EN


This is not the same dataset that was used in the paper, as this data may not be shared publicly. However, it is available from the Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss: http://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home/services-and-publications/advice-and-service/datenportal-fuer-lehre-und-forschung.html

# Running the model
Once the package is installed and loaded, the model may be run with all parameters set to a standard value with the following line:
```R
sim <- run.forhytm(t=erl.temp,p=erl.prec,rh=erl.rh,rg=erl.rg,u=erl.wind,rssd=erl.rssd)
```
This returns an object ```sim``` ```(data.frame)``` containing the daily simulation results. To vary parameter values, specify them as arguments in the function call, e.g.:
```R
sim <- run.forhytm(t=erl.temp,p=erl.prec,rh=erl.rh,rg=erl.rg,u=erl.wind,rssd=erl.rssd,sfc=100,laimax=5)
```
A list of all parameters can be found on the function description page, accessible by typing ```?run.forhytm``` in the R console.
